    You earn Street Cred by achieving the goals laid out in campaigns.  Each campaign is a time-limited initiative focused on a specific effort to make the city better.  Campaigns have both personal and community goals.  If you achieve your personal goal, you earn a Street Cred award; if, together, the community achieves the community goal, a red ribbon will be added to the award. When you claim your profile, you are automatically a participant in every campaign.
